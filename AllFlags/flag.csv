1#afghanistan#Afghanistan use their current flag since the Taliban regime was removed in this country in 2004. After gaining the independance in 1919, their flag has gone through many changes connected with different political events. Current flag is inspired by that one, which was used in the times of monarchy. The only difference is that current one has the national emblem in the middle. It consists of a three vertical colors: black, red and green and the national emblem in the center of the red stripe. The meaning of these colors can be interpreted like this: black means the former Abbasid caliphate, red means royal dignity and green color is the traditional color of the Islam. National emblem is yellow and it consists of a mihrab (a niche in a mosque) and minbar (pulpit) which are placed in a wreath with an inscription "God is great"
2#albania#Albanian flag was adopted in 1912, after gaining the independence from the Ottoman Empire. The current flag consists of a red leaf with a black doubled-headed eagle. The origin of the flag is associated with a national hero Skanderbeger (formerly George Kastrioti), who lived in the fifteenth century and who was a general of the Turkish army. However, Skanderbeger left the army so that he can return to Albania and erect the flag with double-headed egle above the castle of his father in Kruje with words: "I did not bring you freedom. I found it here, among you." After his return to Albania, Skanderbeger managed to unify Albania and defend it against the Turkish attacks
3#algeria#The flag of Algeria consists of two stripes of equal width that have green and white color. At the borderline of the stripes, a red crescent surrounding a five-pointed star is placed. The flag has been used since 1962 when Algeria gained its independence, and it has been inspired by the flag of National Liberation Front. Green color traditionally represents Islam and white color stands for purity. The crescent is taken over from the Turkish flag and it is associated with Islam as well. A white flag was a symbol of national hero Abd al-Qadir, who became famous for the leadership of the resistance against the French rule in the 19th century. The red color of the star and crescent refers to the blood shed during these fights
4#andorra#The flag of the tiny country Andorra, which is situated in the mountains between France and Spain, was adopted in 1866. Andorra was jointly managed for many years by Spain and France. The cooperation was cancelled in 1993, when the country gained independence and became a modern parliamentary democracy. The flag is composed of a vertical tricolor of blue, yellow, and red stripe and a yellow coat of arms in the middle of the yellow stripe. One half of the coat of arms refers to the ties with Spain, whereas the second points to relations to France. Miter and crutches in the upper left quarter of the coat of arms are sign of Spanish bishop and two red cows at the bottom right should commemorate the French province of Bearn
5#angola#The background of Angolan flag, which was adopted in 1975, consists of two horizontal stripes of red and black color of the same width. Red should symbolize the blood shed during the struggle for freedom and black stands for African continent and the black population. The central motif is located at the borderline of these stripes and consists of a yellow five-pointed star surrounded by half of toothed wheel which is cut by machete. At first glance, these symbols evoke the traditional symbols of communism - the star represents socialism, the wheel industry, and the machete stands for the rural population and agriculture. The yellow color of this theme should point to the vast mineral wealth of the country. In 2003, a new flag was designed, but it has not found support among Angolans yet
6#antigua and Barbuda#The flag of Antigua and Barbuda was adopted in 1967 when these two islands in the Caribbean Sea became independent. The design of the flag was created by Antiguan teacher Reginald Samuels. The flag should refer to the past but also to better prospects for the future. The rising sun represents new era, two red triangles on the sides represent the energy of the local population and the black represents its African-American origins. Blue stands for hope and the gradual use of the tricolor of yellow, blue, and white evokes the sun, sea, and sand. Naval flag consists of a red St. George's cross on a white background and the national flag in the upper left corner
7#argentina#The flag of Argentine is strikingly similar to the flag of Uruguay, especially by its blue-and-white design and yellow symbol of sun, which represents the Inca god of sun called Inti. The white stripe is surrounded by two pale blue stripes and a symbol of the sun is located in its middle. The flag was probably designed in 1812 by general Manuel Belgrano, the Argentine patriot that strongly opposed to Spanish domination. The general was allegedly inspired by the Argentine blue sky above the battlefield, or perhaps by the blue military cockades of his soldiers. Still, there are doubts whether he really was the author of the flag
8#armenia#The flag of Armenia, which has been adopted in 1990, consists of three horizontal stripes - red, dark blue, and mustard yellow one. It differs from the flag that had been used until 1920 only by the aspect ratio. Allegedly, the red color represents the blood shed by Armenian soldiers, blue stands for the sky and hope and orange represents the fertile land and Armenian population. Armenia has been the first Christian state, this religion has been adopted in the 4th century. Historically, Armenia was part of several groupings - firstly it was Roman, Byzantine and later Arabic, Persian and Ottoman Empire. The last intervention to the autonomy of the state was an annexation by the Soviet Union in the 20th century
9#australia#The Australian flag was adopted in 1909 and its design reflects historical ties to the Great Britain. As in the case of the British flag, the background is blue, but the Union Jack flag is reduced and placed at the top of the left side. Below the Union Jack, there is a seven-pointed star, whose six tips represent Australian states and the seventh tip refers to two independent federal territories. On the right half of the flag, the constellation of the Southern Cross, which dominates the Australian sky, stretches. Indigenous Australians have their own flag. Via red and black stripes and yellow disc, their flag is trying to represent the indigenous tribes, the earth and the sun
10#austria#The Austrian flag is considered to be one of the oldest flags. It consists of three horizontal stripes of equal width, where the middle one is white and the other two are red. According to the legend, the Babenberg Duke Leopold V. fought in the Crusade for the Holy Land in 1191 at the Battle of Acre so valiantly, that he did not even notice that his white shirt is totally covered in blood. After the battle he realized that he had lost his standard, so he decided to hang his stained shirt instead. When he took off his belt with scabbard, untouched white stripe appeared on his shirt. In the 13th century, the last Babenberg Duke adopted red and white as his colors in order to express admiration and respect to his valiant predecessor
11#azerbaijan#The flag of Azerbaijan consists of three horizontal stripes - the top one is blue, the middle one is red, and the bottom one is green. In the middle of the red stripe, a white crescent and eight-pointed star are placed. Star, crescent, and green color are the traditional symbols of Islam. Eight peaks of the star denote eight Turkic groups inhabiting Azerbaijan and the crescent was borrowed from the Turkish flag. The symbolism of the colors is as follows: blue stripe represents the unity of Turkic groups, red is a symbol of progress and struggle for freedom, and the green stripe refers to the Muslim religion. The flag was officially adopted in 1918, but it was banned during the Soviet rule, and it has not been readopted until gaining the independence in 1991
12#bahamas#Bahamian islands are located in the southeast direction from Florida and it have slightly over 300,000 inhabitants. These islands used to be a British colony until gaining the independence in 1973, when the current flag of the Bahamas was adopted as well. Afterwards, the economy has begun to focus on tourism and trade and this trend remained till nowadays. At the same time, a drug trafficking is a big issue and a large part of the workforce migrates to the USA every year. The black wedge on the left side of the flag is supposed to represent the black population of the island, blue stripes stand for the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. The yellow stripe should evoke the sun, sand, and beautiful local beaches
13#bahrain#The flag of Bahrain is composed of red and white stripe, which are separated by a zigzag line consisting of five triangles. Originally, the flag bore more than five triangles, but their number was reduced to five in 2002, so that they can symbolize five pillars of Islam. Red is the traditional color of the Gulf countries. White stripe has been added on the flag in 1820 after the creation of naval pact with the Great Britain, which inter alia stated an obligation to identify all ships of the pact by a flag with a white stripe. The flag in its current form has been adopted in 1932 and it is often confused with the flag of Qatar, although it has more "teeth" and its shape is more elongated compared to the flag of Bahrain
14#bangladesh#The flag of Bangladesh was adopted on 17th January 1972 and it is very similar to the Japanese flag (except for the green background). Originally, a flag with a golden map of the country was used, however this design was abandoned for the reasons of simplification. Thus, the flag is made up of a green leaf with a red circle. However, the circle is not placed exactly in the center of the flag, but it is shifted slightly to the left, which creates an illusion that the circle is actually located in the middle when the flag is raised. The circle stands for the beginning of independence or for the sun rising over the Bay of Bengal. The green background symbolizes the local fertile landscape and also it is also a traditional color of Islam
15#barbados#Barbados was settled in the 17th century by the British, who founded sugar plantations cultivated by imported black slave population on the island. Sugarcane remained the main commodity even after the abolition of slavery in 1834. Extensive reforms did not take place until the 20th century and the island gained independence from Britain in 1960. And it is this moment that should be symbolized by the black trident separated from the shaft as a central theme of Barbadian flag, which was adopted in 1966. In colonial times, the flag bore a whole trident. Each peak of the trident reminds one democratic principle, two blue vertical stripes represent the sea and the sky, and the middle yellow stripe represents the sand
16#belarus#The Belarusian flag consists of two horizontal stripes - wider red one at the top and narrower green one at the bottom. Moreover, the left edge of the flag is fringed by traditional Belarusian red and white pattern. This ornament is used to decorate folk costumes, and it should indicate the age of Belarusian nation and its manual dexterity and skills. The flag was adopted in 1995 after a referendum and it replaced the flag that Belarus used before annexing to the Soviet Union and after gaining the independence in 1991. However, some interest groups are still using the original flag to express the disagreement with the government and they deem the referendum of 1995 invalid since it allegedly failed to meet democratic principles
17#belgium#The Belgian flag, which was inspired by the French tricolor, was adopted in 1831, shortly after gaining independence from the Netherlands. Originally, the stripes were horizontal, but Belgians eventually inclined to the version with vertical stripes in order to differ from the Dutch flag. The black, yellow and red colors are characteristic of Brabant province - Brabant rebels wore these colors during the uprising against Austria in the late 18th century. For the second time, the tricolor appeared during the uprising against William I of the Netherlands. This riot, unlike the previous one, was successful, that is why the flag evokes the struggle for independence and freedom
18#belize#The flag of Belize has been adopted in 1981, when the country achieved independence from the Great Britain. The flag was designed around 1950, when the country began to fight for independence and is it based on the design of the former flag from this period. At that time, Belize was called British Honduras. The current version of the flag is composed of a blue sheet and a national emblem in the middle. The red stripes are not original and were added after gaining the independence. The national coat of arms shows two workers standing in the shade of mahogany, the first one holding an oar and the second one an ax. Below the workers, there is a ribbon with inscription "Sub umbra floreo" (in the shadow flourish) - which clearly refers to the colonial past of Belize
19#benin#The current flag of Benin has been adopted for the first time in 1960, when the country achieved independence from France. The flag consists of three stripes - two horizontal ones in yellow and red colors and one vertical green on the left side of the flag. These colors are traditional Pan-African colors, where green represents hope, yellow symbolizes wealth and red stands for courage and the bloodshed during the struggles for independence. These colors emphasize the solidarity with the other African nations. In 1975, Marxist government came to power in Benin and the country was renamed to the Republic of Dahomey. In these times, a green flag with a red star in the upper left corner was used. After the fall of the regime in 1990, the previous flag has been readopted
20#bhutan#The flag of Bhutan reflects the country´s name in the local language (Druk Yul), which means "country of the thunder dragon". This name is linked to the Buddhist monastery Druk, which was reportedly founded in the country in the 13th century. The diagonal divides the flag into yellow and orange part. Yellow color refers to the secular side of life, whereas orange indicates the strength of the Buddhist religion in the country. White dragon stands for purity and the jewelry in his talons refer to the great wealth of the country. The dragon stares away from the left part of the flag and his body copies the diagonal line. The current form of the flag was adopted in 1960, however is has been used since the 19th century in a slightly modified form
21#bolivia#The flag of Bolivia, whose official name is the Bolivian multinational state, has been adopted in 1851. It consists of three horizontal stripes in red, yellow and green colors. In the center of the state flag, a coat of arms is placed, however it was dropped from the national flag. The red stripe symbolizes blood shed during the struggles for freedom and also Bolivian fauna, yellow stands for mineral wealth of the country and green is to remind fertility of local land. Bolivia was originally inhabited by Aymaras and later Incas, but it was colonized by Spaniards in the 16th century and the independence has not been gained until 1825. The state was named after Simon Bolivar - the leader of the struggles for freedom
22#bosnia and Herzegovina#The flag of Bosnia and Herzegovina has a very unusual shape. The right part of the flag is made up of vertical blue stripe and the central part is specific by a yellow triangle whose hypotenuse carries seven full and two half white five-pointed stars. The left part is filled with blue color. The blue color together with white stars should refer to the membership of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the Council of Europe. The peaks of the triangle represent three nations - Croats, Serbs, and Bosnians. Blue, white, and yellow color are traditionally associated with peace and neutrality. The flag in its current form was adopted in 1998. Shortly after the declaration of independence from Yugoslavia, a white flag with the coat of arms of Tvrtko Kotromanic from 14th century was used
23#botswana#The flag of Botswana, which has been adopted in 1966 during the declaration of independence, is composed of a pale blue sheet, which bears a black horizontal stripe in its center. Moreover, the entire sheet and the stripe are bounded by a white trim. The symbolism of colors has several interpretations. One of them says that the flag has been inspired by a state symbol, whose motto is Pula (Setswana in the local language), which means "Let there be rain". Therefore, blue color should symbolize water, black and white stripes are supposed to commemorate zebra, the national animal of Botswana and also shield bearer. Three colors can also represent various ethnic groups living in the country and hope for their peaceful coexistence
24#brazil#The draft of the Brazilian flag was designed by professor Teixeira Mendes together with several astronomers and painter Decio Vilares. The flag has truly unique design - the globe in the center of the flag shows the night sky exactly as it could be observed on November 15, 1889 at 8:30 am from Rio de Janeiro (on this day the Brazilian monarchy was brought down). Every single star in the sky represents one state and the globe is surrounded by a yellow diamond, which is set in a green background. The inscription "Ordem e Progresso" on a white ribbon, which goes through the globe, means "Order and Progress". After the monarchy was brought down, a flag similar to the US flag had been adopted, however it was withdrawn after 4 days for the reason of excessive similarity
25#brunei#The flag of Brunei, which has been adopted in 1959, is composed of a yellow leaf, black and white diagonal stripes and a national emblem in the center of the flag. However, it has not obtained status of national flag until 1984, when Brunei gained independence from Britain. National emblem consists of a red crescent at the bottom, two gloves turned to the sky at the sides and an umbrella on the top. The crescent is a traditional symbol of Islam and the umbrella stands for monarchy and royal dignity. Wings with four feathers adorning the umbrella are supposed to guard integrity and peace. Yellow is a typical color of Sultan and the diagonal stripes has been added in 1906 when Brunei became a British colony
26#bulgaria#The Bulgarian flag, which was adopted in 1991, is made up of tricolor of horizontal stripes of white, green, and red color. Originally, it was very similar to the Russian flag since it had the typical Pan-Slavic colors, however, the blue stripe has been replaced by a green one in 1878, so that it better reflects the agricultural character of the country. White stripe represents peace, green fertility of the soil and the red one stands for courage of the Bulgarians. Until 1990, the upper left part held an emblem with lion surrounded by wheat spikes, which were tied with a red ribbon with inscriptions 681 and 1944. In 681, the state was founded and in 1944, it was liberated from the Nazis. After the collapse of the Soviet Union the coat of arms was removed, and only three colored stripes remained
27#burkina Faso#The flag of Burkina Faso consists of two horizontal stripes in red and green colors and a golden star located in the center of the flag on the borderline of these stripes. The colors used are typical examples of pan-African colors, however, the official explanation says that the red symbolizes the socialist revolution and that the green color stands for natural wealth of the country. Burkina Faso was a French colony until 1960 and it was called Upper Volta. The flag has been adopted in 1984 when the country was renamed to Burkina Faso (in translation "a country of unbribables") after the series of military coups. The colors also refer to solidarity towards other African nations and the golden star recalls the guiding light of the revolution
28#burundi#Unusual flag of Burundi has been adopted on March 28, 1967. Its central theme is a white cross and a white circle in the middle of the flag. The cross divides the flag into four parts, where the upper and the lower fields are red and the left and the right field are green. In the white circle, there are three six-pointed stars, which allegedly represent national motto: "Unity, work, and progress." The stars may also symbolize the three main ethnical groups of Burundi, which are Hutus, Tutsis and Pygmies. Green color indicates hope for better future, while red traditionally recalls the blood shed during the struggle for freedom. The white color of the cross symbolizes peace
29#cambodia#The current flag of Cambodia was adopted in 1993 and consists of two blue stripes and one red stripe in-between. The red stripe bears a white silhouette of the temple Angkor Wat in its center. This symbol of Khmer dynasty from the 12th century is considered to be one of the biggest dominant of Cambodia. The towers of the temple should resemble Mount Meru, home of Hindu gods. The blue stripes stand for dignity, red stripe represents the nation, and white color refers to the power of religion. Until 1989, the flag with a yellow outline of the temple on a red sheet was used, but after the civil war and restoring the monarchy in 1993, King Sihanouk inclined to adoprion of the current flag
30#cameroon#The flag of Cameroon consists of three vertical stripes in traditional pan-African colors - green, red, and yellow. In the middle of the central red stripe, a yellow five-pointed star is placed. As in case of other African states, the design of the flag was inspired by the French flag. Originally, Cameroon was divided into the British and the French part, but in 1961 a federation was created and two stars representing each of the original colonial powers were added on the flag. After some time, one of the stars was omitted as an expression of unity and integrity of Cameroon. Today, the star is interpreted as a unity, green color evokes forests, red stands for independence, and yellow refers to Cameroon´s savannahs and sun
31#canada#The current Canadian flag was raised up in 1965 for the first time. Its author was Dr. George Stanley, who intended to capture several important elements of Canadian history. The central theme of the flag is a maple leaf, which refers to the indigenous population that has been using the maple sap for centuries, and which still is a traditional Canadian product. Maple leaf became a symbol of Canadian athletes in the 20th century and also a symbol of Canadian soldiers in both world wars. Red leaf is placed on a white background and the flag is lined with two vertical red stripes. Red and white are referring to historical ties to the UK – it was red and white flag with the St. George's cross which was erected by John Cabot on Canadian soil in 1497
32#cape verde#The flag of Cape Verde, which has been adopted in 1992, is composed of a blue sheet and three stripes in white and red colors. The flag also bears ten five-pointed stars arranged in a circle where the circle is centered toward the left side of the flag. The blue color represents the sea and the sky and two white and one red stripe should commemorate the country's development and the path towards progress. Ten stars represent ten islands of Cape Verde archipelago and the circle is to symbolize the unity of the nation. The islands lying near the west coast of Africa were settled by the Portuguese in the 19th century and in these times it was an important trade crossroad
33#central african republic#The flag of the Central African Republic has been adopted in 1958 and it was designed by president of the Oubangui-Chari province Barthelemy Boganda, a big advocate of partnership with France. The flag consists in total of five stripes, four of which are horizontal and one is vertical. Red, white and blue stripes refer to the colonial past of the country and pan-African colors red, yellow and green refer to solidarity with the other African nations. The red vertical bar that connects the other stripes should commemorate bloodshed during various struggles for freedom. Moreover, at the top of the left part of the flag, a yellow five-pointed star - a symbol of African unity, progress and tolerance, is placed
34#chad#The flag of Chad consists of a vertical tricolor of blue, yellow and red stripes. The flag is almost identical to the flag of Romania, but its blue stripe has a darker shade. The flag has been inspired by the French tricolor as Chad was for many years a French colony. At the same time, it carries two Pan-African colors and therefore refers to ties both to France and the other African countries. The blue stripe on the left side of the flag represents the African sky and waterways, yellow stripe symbolizes the sun and dry desert in northern part of Chad and red traditionally stands for courage and the bloodshed during the struggles for independence. The flag has been adopted in 1959, when Chad was freed from the French rule
35#chile#Chilean flag bears the colors of flag of the United States and it has origins in the period of struggles for liberation in 1817. The flag is composed of red and white horizontal stripes, and a blue square with a white five-pointed star in the upper left part of the flag. White should symbolize, like the name of the country itself (Tchili means snow in the local language), the snowy peaks of the Andes. The blue represents the sky beneath which blood was shed during the local struggles for independence. These fights are reminded by the red stripe. The origin of the star is associated with the Chilean Indians - its white color allegedly represents the unity and freedom of the nation, and the five points represent the five original provinces of the country
36#colombia#The Colombian flag consists of three horizontal stripes - yellow, red, and blue one, where the yellow one is wider compared to the other stripes. The flag should express the unity of the Colombian population which has experienced many difficulties over time. Yellow color symbolizes Colombian gold, blue the Pacific Ocean bathing the Colombian shores, and the red refers to the blood shed during the struggle for freedom. Other interpretations says that yellow indicates sovereignty, blue nobility, and red bravery. After its discovery, Colombia became a Spanish colony and did not gain independence until the 19th century. The modern history could be characterized by political instability and fight against drugs in the countryside
37#comoros#Comoros Islands are situated between Madagascar and Africa. Their current flag has been adopted in 2001 after series of changes. The flag had three variants from 1978 to 2001, though all of them consisted of green leaf, white crescent and four white five-pointed stars in different variations. Today's version is enriched by four horizontal stripes in yellow, white, red and blue colors. Traditional symbols of Islam - a crescent and stars are now located in the green wedge on the left side of the flag. Each stripe as well as four stars represent four main islands of Comoros - Mohéli, Mayotte, Anjouan and Grande Comore. Mayotte has an official status of the French overseas territory, however, Comors Island do not recognize it
38#cook islands#The flag of the Cook Islands, which has been used since 1979, is composed of a dark blue leaf, Union Jack in the upper left part and fifteen white five-pointed stars arranged to the circle. Union Jack refers to the times of British protectorate, nowdays, Cook islands are loosely associated territory of New Zealand. Fifteen equally large stars represent the main islands of the archipelago and their equal status. White and blue are the colors of the Democratic Party, which has been in power since 1979. Officially, blue denotes Pacific Ocean and white stands for the peaceful nature of local population. Before 1979, green-yellow flag that reflected colors of the former ruling part was used
39#costa rica#The flag of Costa Rica is composed of five horizontal stripes of blue, white, red, white, and blue colors in the ratio 1: 1: 2: 1: 1. On the left side of the red stripe, a national coat of arms from 1848 is placed, though it was redesigned in 1906. The emblem consists of an image of three Costa Rican volcanoes surrounded by the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean on whose surface a sailboat sails. Moreover, the sun rises above the volcanoes and it dominates the sky along with seven five-pointed stars, which represent the seven provinces of Costa Rica. The coat of arms also contains two inscriptions - REPUBLICA DE COSTA RICA and CENTRAL AMERICA. The red stripe was added on the flag in 1848 - since that time the flag resembles the French tricolor and thus indirectly celebrates the French Revolution
40#cote d`Ivoire#The flag of Cote d´Ivoire was adopted in 1959 and it is composed of three vertical stripes - orange one, white one, and turquoise one. Ivory Coast is a former French colony which achieved independence in 1960. It is also the reason why the flag resembles the French tricolor at the first glance, but in a different color combination. Orange stripe is supposed to symbolize the desert and savannahs in the northern part of the country and also the progress of the country, white stripe stands for peace, national unity and ripples on the surface of the local rivers Sassandra, Bandama and Kamo, and green stripe marks hope for better future and lush tropical rain forests in the southern part of the country
41#croatia#The Croatian flag has undergone numerous changes that followed the political events in the country. After the establishment of the socialist Croatia in 1949, Pan-Slavic tricolor (blue, white, red) was chosen as the official flag together with the Yugoslav guerrilla star in the middle. After gaining the independence in 1991, the star was replaced with coat of arms of the country and a crown was later added in order to distinguish the flag from the Ustasha flag. The flag and the coat of arms have great importance for Croatians. Checkered shield of the coat of arms represents the Croatian nation and five small crests represent Croatian provinces - Old Croatia from the left, Dubrovnik, Dalmatia, Istria, and Slavonia
42#cuba#The Cuban flag consists of five horizontal stripes where two are white and three are blue. In the left part of the flag, a red triangle and a white five-pointed star are located. The flag was adopted in 1902, but it was designed already in 1849 by Narciso Lopez. Lopez was fighting for independence from Spain and he wanted Cuba to join the United States. And that is why he placed there one white star (in Spanish "Estrella Solitaria"), which, according to his plan, should later become one of the stars on the American flag. This vision, however, never materialized and Cuba became a communist country. Three blue stripes denote three Cuban departments, white purity of ideals of people fighting for independence, and red recalls the blood shed during these fights. Each of the peaks of the triangle points to one of the ideals of the Cuban revolution - liberty, equality, and fraternity
43#cyprus#The flag of Cyprus consists of a yellow silhouette of the island and two crossed branches on a white background. Yellow color evokes copper resources on the island, which are reflected even in the name “Cyprus” itself since it is derived from a Greek word for copper. Crossed branches should represent the desire for peaceful coexistence between Greek Cypriots and Turks inhabiting the island. Blue and red as the colors of the Greek and the Cypriot flags were not used on purpose. The current flag came into force in 1960 after gaining the independence over the Great Britain and it was designed by elementary school teacher and approved by the first president of Cyprus. The flag could have been replaced in 2004, but the proposal did not pass through referendum. Turkish Cypriots use their own flag, nevertheless it is not internationally recognized
44#czech republic#The flag of the Czech Republic consists of two equally broad stripes, where the lower one is red and the upper one is white. Between the stripes in the left part of the flag, there is a blue wedge. The flag symbolizes national unity, which has been very important for the country whose identity has been tested so many times during the last century. In 1918, an independent Czechoslovak state was formed and in these times, we can find the origin of the current flag. After the WWII in 1948, the country´s government was overtaken by communists and in 1993 Czechoslovakia split into the independent Czech Republic and Slovakia. After the separation, the Czech Republic kept the flag and the interpretation of the flag has been changed slightly. Blue wedge, which originally represented Slovakia, stands for Moravia today
45#democratic republic of congo#The current flag of the Democratic Republic of Congo, which has been adopted after the approval of a new constitution in 2006, is composed of a blue sheet, red diagonal stripe and a yellow five-pointed star at the top of the left part of the flag. Blue symbolizes peace, red stands for blood of martyrs, yellow color that frames the red stripe denotes prosperity and the star represents hope for a brighter future of the country. DRC was under the Belgian domination until 1960 and in 1971 it was renamed to Zaire. At that time the flag was brought out in traditional pan-African colors. However, after the overthrow of the government in 1996 this form was abandoned and a flag with six small and one large five-pointed star was used until 2006
46#denmark#The Danish flag, also called Danneborg ("Danish cloth" in Danish), consists of a red background and white cross which extends to the edges of the flag. The vertical arm of the cross follows the model of the other Scandinavian flag thus it is located closer to the left side of the flag. According to the legend, the flag was sent down from heaven in order to help the Danish army on June 15, 1219 during the Battle of Lyndanise. King Valdemar II. would nearly lose the battle against the pagan Estonians, if there was not a sign from heaven that gave the army new energy that helped them to win the battle. The flag is also used in a little bit modified version as a naval flag - it is square and it has two little flags similar to swallowtail
47#djibouti#The flag of Djibouti, which was used for the first time during the declaration of independence in 1977, consists of two horizontal stripes in blue and green colors and a white wedge in the left part of the flag. Moreover, a red five-pointed star is located in the white wedge. The flag has been inspired by the flag of the National League for Independence, which established itself in the struggles for independence from France. Djibouti was known as Somaliland in colonial times. The blue color of the upper bar is typical of the Somali Issas and the green color of the lower bar represents the Muslim Afars. White triangle traditionally symbolizes peace and the red star symbolizes the unity of the Djibouti nation

Until 1833 Ecuador was a part of so called Gran Colombia along with Colombia, Panama, and Venezuela. Therefore, the colors of the flag refer to the colors used on the flags of all fromer members of this federation. Another interpretation says that the yellow and red refer to Spain and the blue color stands for the ocean separating the country from Spain. Allegedly, the flag was designed by the leader of the resistance against Spanish domination general Francisco de Miranda. The coat of arms in the middle of the flag, which is often omitted, displays the Andean condor prepared to defeat any enemy and to protect the Ecuadorian nation under his wings

Black should commemorate sorrows of the Estonian population but it also refers to the traditional black vest of local farmers. White indicates snow, which covers Estonian soil for a large part of the year, and it also expresses the desire for freedom. For this reason, the flag was banned by the Soviet regime between the years 1940 and 1990 and it has not been officially readopted until 1990 when Estonia became independent state
57#ethiopia#The origin of the color base of the flag of Ethiopia is shrouded in mystery. One possible interpretation says that the colors green, yellow and red are referring to the colors of the rainbow, which is not unusual phenomenon in Ethiopia at all - it can be found at the waterfalls on the Blue Nile almost permanently. The apparent resemblance to the flag of Bolivia is most likely just a coincidence. Since Ethiopia is the oldest sovereign state in Africa, the tricolor was later adopted by a number of newly emerging countries with reference to this fact. Moreover, the flag of Ethiopia carries a national emblem that has been added in 1996 and which shows a yellow pentagram with five rays located in a blue circle. This symbol is to remind that all Ethiopians stands equal

65#ghana#Ghana was the first African state that chose to use traditional Pan-African colors (red, yellow, and green) on its flag.

The flag in its present form was adopted in 1822. The cross was moved to the top left part of the flag and white and blue stripes were added. Nine striped should probably remind nine syllables of a revolutionary slogan "Eleftheria i Thanatos" ("Freedom or Death"). Blue symbolizes the sea, whose beauty inspired the idea of revolt.

83#jamaica#The flag of Jamaica was adopted in 1962, when the country gained independence. Jamaica, which was a British colony for centuries, had a role of center of trade with slaves. After the abolition of slavery in 1838, a violent coup took place and as a result, Jamaica is characterized by social problems and high criminality till nowadays. The flag was chosen in a public tender and it should reflect the turbulent Jamaican history. The version with horizontal stripes was rejected for being too similar to the flag of former Republic of Tanganika. Pan-African colors of black, green and yellow were thus situated to the form of Saint Andrew´s Cross and it should express a motto: "Hardships there are but the land is green and the sun shineth". Yellow color represents the sun, black stands for difficulties and green means the land

The white color on the former flag represented peace, blue water and rain, and green prosperity. The current appearance of the flag, which has been adopted on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the independence of the country should to express tolerance and peaceful orientation of Lesotho
96#liberia#The flag of Liberia, which has been adopted in 1847, at first glance resembles the flag of the United States, and thus reflects its colonial past. However, Liberia was not a classic colony, it served since 1822 as a colony for freed slaves from the United States. Instead of the white star, the original flag displayed a Christian cross, which has later been replaced by a star in order to highlight an independence of Liberia. Eleven white or red stripes refer to eleven men who signed the Declaration of Independence of Liberia. The blue rectangle in the upper left part of the flag stands for the African continent and the star itself symbolizes the shining light of Liberia
97#libya#The flag of Libya has been altered many times in the last century. Until 2011, a purely green leaf was used since green is the color of Islam as well as of Libya. It also should have commemorated the Green Revolution of Muammar Gaddafi. Since the beginning of the civil war in 2011 a flag from the times of the Libyan Kingdom has been used as a symbol of the revolution. The current flag thus consists of three horizontal stripes, where the top one is red, the middle one is wider and black and the bottom one is green. In the middle of the black bar, a white crescent and a five-pointed star are placed. Each of the bars represents one Libyan region and the crescent with the star are traditional symbols of Islam

The flag consists of two horizontal stripes of equal width, where the upper one is blue and the bottom one is red. In the left part of the blue bar, motif of a golden prince crown is located. The crown was added in 1937 in order not to be confused with the former flag of Haiti at Berlin´s Olympic Games. In the same year, a new interpretation of the flag was accepted. It says that the blue stripe symbolizes the sky, the red stripe represents the glow of fires during the evening gatherings, and the gold one stands for physical and mental unity of the nation, the state, and the royal house
99#lithuania#The Lithuanian flag consists of a tricolor of horizontal stripes in yellow, green and red colors.

After the collapse of the Sovier Union in 1989, the tricolor has been readopted as the national flag. Selected colors allegedly reflect Lithuanian values and local nature. Yellow represents the sun and fertile cornfields, green stands for forests and meadows and red refers to the bloodshed in the struggle for the country's independence and for the courage of Lithuanians during these fights. The flag that is used nowadays differs only by dimensions from the flag used before the Soviet occupation
100#luxembourg#The flag of Luxembourg is composed of a red-white-blue tricolor in a horizontal form. Luxembourg created a personal union with the Netherlands in the 19th century, as a result, their flags are very similar. However, the blue stripe of Luxembourg´s flag is lighter and the ratio of sides is different as well. Luxembourg was a long time under the Habsburgs rule and it did not achieved independence until 1867, although it was officially declared the Grand Duchy at the Congress of Vienna in 1815 already. The flag was adopted in 1972 and the colors of the tricolor were taken from the coat of arms of the Grand Duchy, which depicts a red two-tailed lion on a red and blue background

The previous flag that was still used in the early 20th century was composed only of a red leaf, which was common to many Arab island territories.
106#mali#The flag of Mali, which has been adopted in 1961, is composed of a vertical tricolor consisting of green, yellow and red stripes. These colors have a classical pan-African symbolism - green indicates the forests and the land's fertility, yellow represents the sharp local sun and red recalls the blood shed during the struggles for freedom. Mali originally formed a federation with Sudan and they shared one flag, which was compared to its present form enriched by a figure of a black man called "Kanaga" placed in the middle of the yellow stripe. Senegal, however, left the federation and replaced the figure by a star. Neither Mali did stick to this form of the flag and the "Kanaga" was removed from both flags. The reason was that the majority of the population are Muslims and it is unacceptable for them to portray the human figure on the flag.
107#malta#The flag of Malta consists of two vertical stripes of white and red color, and a cross of St. George lined with red at the top of the left side of the flag. Cross with an inscription "FOR GALLANTRY" was given to Malta by the British as an honor for resilience during the bombing by a German-Italian troops during the World War II. The flag was officially adopted after gaining the independence in 1964, and its design is probably derived from the flag of the Norman Hauteville House, which conquered Malta in the late 11th century.

It happened on an island in lake Texcoco, where they settled and founded the city of Tenochtitlan (in the area of today's capital). The symbolism of colors is as follows: green stands for independence, white for chastity and purity of religion, and red refers to blood union of local ethnic groups - the blood of Spanish, Indian and bi-racial.
112#micronesia#The flag of the Federated States of Micronesia, which has been adopted on 10 November 1979, consists of a pale blue leaf on which four white five-pointed stars are placed. Since Micronesia is a grouping of islands located in the Pacific Ocean, bright blue background represents the ocean that surrounds the islands. The four main islands (and federated states) called Chuuk, Pohnpei, Yap and Kusrae are represented through the stars. Originally, the flag of Micronesia was carrying six stars, but after the departure of the Marshall Islands and the Northern Mariana Islands from the Federation two stars were removed. Flags of similar character are typical of number of states in Oceania.
113#moldova#The flag of Moldova consists of a vertical tricolor of blue, yellow and red stripes. This base is identical to the flag of Romania, however, in the middle of the yellow stripe, a Moldovan national emblem is placed. It depicts a golden eagle holding a golden cross in its beak, an olive branch in one talon and a scepter in the other. The eagle holds a shield where a bison's head is displayed - it should denote strength, independence and pride of the Moldovan nation. Until 2010, the national emblem was used on the face side of the flag only, so the flag of Moldova belonged to the few flags with different sides. At the present time, there is a mirror version of national emblem on the reverse side.
114#monaco#The flag of Monaco consists of two horizontal stripes of equal width - the top one is red and the bottom one is white.

Finally, in 1861 it joined France again, but as an independent state this time. The flag was adopted on 4th April 1881 and is it very similar to the flag of Indonesia, whose proportions are only slightly different.

115#mongolia#The flag of Mongolia, which has been adopted in 1992, is composed of three vertical stripes, where the middle one is blue and the other two are red. In the left red stripe, a yellow ideogram called sojombo, which is connected with ancient symbolism resulting from Buddhist traditions, is placed. The upper part of the symbol is made up of three flames, which should refer to the past, present and the future. The moon and sun symbols represent the idea of the world and eternity. Another symbol included in sojombo is yin and yang - a traditional Buddhist symbol of harmony of the opposites, which is portrayed by two endlessly outrunning fish. The two rectangles on the sides of sojombo represent a wall, which according to the Mongolian saying represents a friendship that is stronger than any stone wall.
116#montenegro#The flag of Montenegro is composed of a red leaf framed by a gold trimming which has a width of 1/20 height of the flag. The aspect ratio of 1: 3 forms unusually elongated shape of the flag. In the center of the flag, a national emblem is placed.

117#morocco#The Moroccan flag consists of a red leaf where a green pentagram or "Seal of Solomon" is placed. This symbol was added on the flag in 1915 in order to distinguish it from the flags of other Arabic nations. Green and red are traditional colors of Islam, and the red color has been present on the Moroccan flag since the 16th century. Red is supposed to symbolize the blood kinship between the Prophet Muhammad and the king, but sometimes it is interpreted as a symbol of freedom of the nation. Until 1956, Morocco was a French colony, but unlike other colonized nations, Morocco did not adopt the French tricolor flag and managed to retain its own flag during this period.
118#mozambique#The flag of Mozambique has been adopted in 1983 and Mozambique is currently the only country whose flag bears a symbol of a weapon. The flag consists of three stripes in green, black and yellow colors, which are separated by narrower white stripes. On the left side there is a red wedge where symbols of yellow star, white book, hoe and Kalashnikov are layered. The flag has been inspired by the flag of the Liberation Front of Mozambique which was fighting for independence. The symbolism of colors is as follows: green represents fertile ground, black African population and yellow stands for mineral wealth. The hoe refers to the agricultural population, the book highlights the importance of education and the weapon commemorates the fights for freedom. White color traditionally symbolizes peace.
119#myanmar#The current flag of Myanmar has been adopted along with a new constitution in 2010 and it is composed of three horizontal stripes in red, green and yellow colors. In the middle of the flag, a large white five-pointed star is placed. The flag has been inspired by the flag of Burma from the period around the World War II. The yellow stripe refers to solidarity between people, green stands for natural wealth of the country, and the red stripe reminds courage of the local population during numerous fights. The white star symbolizes hope in the unity of all people living in the country. The flag, however, is not viewed positively by everybody, the opposition of the current government, for instance, considers it to be a symbol of attempts to forced assimilation of local ethnic groups.
120#namibia#The current flag of Gabon has been adopted in 1960 when the country declared independence from France. It is composed of three horizontal stripes from the top in green, yellow and blue colors. The flag should signal solidarity with the other independent African states since the first two bands were taken from the flag of Ethiopia. Moreover, it refers to the former ties to France as Gabon´s colonizer (via the blue bar). Green stripe symbolizes the Gabonese forest and timber industry, yellow stripe stands for the local sharp sun and the zero parallel, which passes through the country. Blue bar represents the Atlantic Ocean, which washes the western shores of the country, as well as all waters of the country - especially the river Ogooué.
121#nauru#The base of the flag of Nauru, the smallest independent country in the world, which has been adopted in 1976 when the country achieved independence, consists of a dark blue sheet. The sheet is crossed by a yellow stripe in its middle and below the stripe and closer to the left part of the flag a twelve-pointed white star is placed. Each chip represents one of the twelve tribes that used to inhabit the island, although two of them do not exist already. Yellow stripe symbolizes the equator and the star depicts the position of the island against the equator. The blue color of the sheet should remind the Pacific Ocean, which surrounds the island. The design of the flag was chosen through a public competition, where a draft of an Australian designer won.
122#nepal#Unconventionally shaped flag of Nepal, which was adopted in 1962 together with Nepalese constitution, is made up of two orthogonal triangles where one is placed on the top of the other, both lined with a blue stripe. This shape emerged from a combination of two flags of competing branches of Rana dynasty that once ruled this country. The upper triangle bears a white silhouette of the moon, which represents the royal family and its power. The lower triangle that holds the symbol of the sun stands for Rana family and the political power. The combination of these two symbologies should represent the hope for Nepalese independence to last as long as there is the sun and the moon. The flag´s serrate shape also evokes the peaks of the Himalayas. Red color of the background indicates energy.
123#netherlands#The Dutch flag is composed of a red-white-blue tricolor and it is also known as "The Prince's Flag". Records about the prince William of Orange´s flag appeared already in 1572, when William led the resistance against the Spanish domination, however the flag was originally orange, white and blue. Later, the orange stripe was replaced by a red one so that it was better visible on the seas. Dutch tricolor is the oldest national tricolor flag, and it served as an inspiration for the French and Russian tricolor. As the Russian flag later influenced many Slavic flags, the Dutch tricolor indirectly affected these flags as well. The Dutch flag is considered to be one of the oldest flags which retained its design even over times of various coups.
124#new zealand#At first sight, the flag of New Zealand reflects its colonial past. Both Union Jack flag in the upper left corner and the blue background point to former ties to the Great Britain. Four red stars with white framing symbolize a constellation of the Southern Cross, which dominates the sky there. The same motif can be found on the Australian flag, so it highlights the fact that both countries are located in the Pacific Ocean in mutual geographic proximity. Officially, the blue color expresses blue sea and clear sky in the vicinity of New Zealand. The flag was adopted on 24th March 1902, but it was already designed as a naval flag in 1869.
125#nicaragua#The flag of Nicaragua, which has been used since 1908, is composed of three horizontal stripes in blue, white and blue colors. In the middle of the white stripe, there is a national coat of arms in the shape of a triangle. The emblem displays five volcanoes that are supposed to represent five states of former United Provinces of Central America - along with Nicaragua it was Honduras, Guatemala, Costa Rica and El Salvador. A rainbow extends over the volcanoes together with Phrygian cap of liberty and white torches. Two blue stripes are to remind the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean, but also justice and loyalty. White traditionally symbolizes purity and honesty. Similar symbolism can be found on the flags of El Salvador and Costa Rica.
126#niger#The flag of African country Niger, which has been adopted a year before gaining its independence in 1959, consists of three horizontal stripes in orange, white and green colors. Moreover, in the middle of the white stripe, an orange circle is placed. The symbolism of colors used is as follows: red represents the Sahara Desert in the north, white stands for purity, green for hope or Nigerian vegetation in the southern parts of the country. Orange circle is to commemorate the bright sun illuminating the local rivers and landscape. The three stripes also represent three main regions of the country. The color variation may remind the flag of Ivory Coast, which was as well as Niger colonized by French.
127#nigeria#The Nigerian flag was adopted after gaining independence from Britain in 1960. The flag was chosen in 1959 from more than 200 drafts and the winning "designer" was a student from the city Ibadan Michael Taiwo. Originally, the flag consisted of three vertical stripes - two green on sides and one white in-between. Moreover, there was a red sun in the middle of the white stripe, but it was omitted later on, so only three stripes remained till nowadays. The flag should evoke the river Niger undulating between the greenery of Nigerian fields and forests. Another interpretation says that Green refers to the agricultural tradition of Nigeria and that white stripe represents peace.
128#niue#The flag of the Pacific island of Niue is composed of a yellow leaf and a miniature of Union Jack in the upper left corner. Union Jack bears five stars, the largest of which is located in the middle and the other four are placed in the vertical and horizontal stripes. Union Jack points to the fact that Niue is a former British colony. The yellow color of the leaf reportedly indicates warm relations with New Zealand and the four stars represent the Southern Cross constellation which dominates the sky in this part of the world. A big star in the middle of the blue circle symbolizes the independence of the island - currently, Niue is associated territory of New Zealand.
129#north korea#The flag of North Korea, or the Korean People's Democratic Republic, is composed of red leaf, fringed with blue lines at the top and at the bottom, which are bordered with a white stripes from its inner side. Closer to the left side of the flag, there is a white circle bearing a red five-pointed star. The design of the flag itself indicates that North Korea is a communist country. The flag was adopted in 1948 after the departure of the Soviet troops from the country and it expresses the revolutionary ideas of the North Korean people and its leader Kim Ir-sen. The red color refers to the blood shed during the socialist revolution or to patriotism, blue to peace, and white stands for purity and chastity.
130#norway#The design of the Norwegian flag with the Scandinavian cross in the center is similar to the other Nordic flags. In case of Norway, the cross is blue with white framing, placed on a red background. The cross is not isosceles, it reaches the edges of the flag and the shorter arm is located closer to the left side of the flag. The flag is very similar to the Danish Danneborg, which reflects four centuries under the Danish rule. On the other hand, the blue cross points to the long-term ties to Sweden. The flag was designed in 1821 by Frederick Meltzer, but it was not adopted as a state flag until 1898. The colors of the flag that coincide with the French tricolor could be interpreted as an expression of the desire for independence that Norway did not reach until the beginning of the 20th century.
131#oman#The flag of Oman is composed of three horizontal stripes in white, red and green colors and red vertical stripe on the left side of the flag. These colors are traditional for Arab nations and symbolize the unity among them. At the top of the left red stripe, a white coat of arms of sultans is placed. It portrays two crossed sabers in decorated scabbards, dagger and pylons. Another interpretation of the colors says that red is to commemorate the Islamic Ibadijs, white is the color of peace and green represents the mountains Jebel Akhdar (Green Mountains in translation) and the Muslim faith of the local people. The flag has been used with slight modifications since 1970.
132#pakistan#At first glance, the flag of Pakistan suggests that Pakistan is a Muslim state. A rectangular leaf carries two traditional symbols of Islam on a green background - a white crescent and five-pointed star, where the crescent indicates progress and the star stands for knowledge and light. The white stripe on the left side of the flag is supposed to represent Pakistani minorities (Hindus, Christians, and Buddhists), and thus indirectly expresses religious tolerance in the country. White, together with the green color, also marks peace and prosperity. The flag was inspired by the flag of All-India Muslim League, which pushed for the division of British India into two separate states in 1947 - Hindu India and Muslim Pakistan.
133#palau#The flag of Palau has been adopted on 1st January 1981, when the archipelago decided to separate from the territory of the Pacific Islands and it was proclaimed a republic under the protection of the United States. The flag is composed of a pale blue sheet and a yellow circle centered slightly toward the left side of the flag. When the flag is hung it creates an impression that the circle is located right in the center of the flag. Blue color symbolizes the Pacific Ocean that surrounds the islands and the yellow circle allegedly resembles the full moon, which is an important period for the islanders. They believe that activities such as fishing, planting and harvesting are much more effective during this moon-phase.
134#panama#The flag of Panama is divided into four fields - along one diagonal there is a fully blue and red field, along the second diagonal there are two white boxes bearing blue and red star. Panama has always been of interest of the world powers for its strategic geographical position. Firstly, the Spanish ruled the country, later Colombians, and it did not became independent until 1903. Shortly after that the United States began to build the Panama Canal, which was completed in 1914. The flag designed by President Amador Guerra should express a desire to solve the structural problems of domestic policy that have been caused by considerable external interventions. Blue and red color represent the democrats and socialists and the white background of the fields with stars stands for peace.
135#papua new guinea#The flag of Papua New Guinea is considered one of the most beautiful and most spectacular ones. It is divided diagonally into two triangular sections - black bottom one and red top one. At the bottom part, five stars depicting the Southern Cross constellation following flags of Australia and New Zealand are placed. The upper red part of the flag is dominated by a golden silhouette of a bird of paradise in flight, which is the national symbol of the country. The red, yellow and black colors have been used by the indigenous population for decorating objects of folk art for a long time. The flag has been adopted in 1971 - that is, four years before the official independence was proclaimed.
136#paraguay#The flag of Paraguay has been adopted in 1842 by President Rodriguez de Francia, a great admirer of France. That is why he chose the colors of the French tricolor for the national flag, however, he decided to place the stripes horizontally. The flag is unique because of its obverse and reverse sides are different. The center of the white stripe on the front of the flag bears a national coat of arms where a yellow five-pointed star surrounded by a green wreath and an inscription "República del Paraguay" is placed. Allegedly, the star was shining over the capital city Asuncion in 1811 when the independence of Paraguay was declared. The reverse side is decorated with an emblem of the Ministry of Finance and an inscription "Paz y Justicia" at the same place.
137#the people's republic of china#The flag of People Republic of China was adopted in 1949, when Mao Zedong founded the Republic. The dominant color of the flag is red, which is Chinese traditional color and also is characteristic of communism and revolutionary moods. In the left part of the flag, we can find one large and four small stars, whose symbolism can be interpreted in many different ways. One theory says that the large star represents the Communist Party and the small stars stand for four social classes in China - workers, farmers, entrepreneurs, and capitalists. Another explanation agrees on the big star, but insists that the small stars symbolize the four smaller parties that were allowed in China. According to others, the stars may symbolize the five largest ethnic groups in the country.
138#peru#The flag of Peru consists of three horizontal stripes, where the side ones are red and the middle one is white. In the center of the white stripe, a shield taken from the national character that was designed before 1825 by José Georgiou Parades is placed. The shield is divided into three fields, where the first one depicts vicuna – a national animal of Peru belonging to the same family as camel does. Next to vicuna, there is a portrait of cinchona tree, from which alkaloid quinine, which is used to cure malaria, is extracted. At the bottom of the coat of arms, a horn full of coins that should point to the mineral wealth of the country is displayed.
139#the philippines#The flag of the Philippines has been adopted in 1946 when the country gained independence from the US. It was designed in the 19th century by the leader of the uprising against the Spanish domination Emilio Aguinaldo, who defeated the enemy on 28 May 1898 at the battle of Alapan. Tricolor of white, red and blue was chosen with reference to the United States used to rule the country. Thus, the flag is composed of two horizontal stripes of red, blue, and a white triangle in the left part of the flag. Three golden stars in each of the peaks of the triangle represent the three main islands of the Philippines - Mindanao, Luzon and Visayas. In the middle of the wedge, there is a golden sun with eight rays in the shape of a sword, symbolizing the first eight founding provinces. Interesting fact is that the flag can indicate a state of war if it is displayed with the red stripe on top.
140#poland#The Polish flag consists of two equally broad stripes – red one at the bottom and white one on top. The colors are derived from the Polish emblem - a white eagle on a red background. This emblem dates back to the Middle Ages, and although the eagle was removed from the flag, white and red became the traditional colors of Poles. Polish identity has undergone numerous pitfalls over the centuries, therefore these colors have been of great importance for the Polish people, regardless of the current political situation. The symbolism of these colors has many interpretations. It may denote a white eagle flying over the sunset, or connection of the human spirit with the blood shed for freedom. Another interpretation is the wish of the Polish to live in peace and socialism.
141#portugal#The Portuguese flag is composed of green and red stripe, and the national coat of arms. The stripes don´t have the same width and the center of the coat of arms is placed at the borderline between these two stripes. The red color symbolizes the blood shed during the Portuguese revolution in 1910 and the green color stands for hope. Five blue emblems on a white field are allegedly reminder of five Moorish kings, who the first Portuguese king Afonso Henriques had to defeat. Its cross position points to the Christian tradition. Seven castles on the larger red emblem symbolize the seven castles that Alfons had to conquer. Golden navigation device in the background of the coat of arms refers to the Portuguese past as a colonial power.
142#qatar#The flag of Qatar was adopted in 1981 when Qatar became an independent state. Maroon color on the right side of the flag evokes the sharp sun's rays of Qatar´s sun hitting the red cloth, or it may refer to the natural dye frequently used in Qatar which has a similar color. Chestnut stripe is separated from the right one by nine white teeth. Originally, the flag was whole red and white stripe was adopted as a sign that the country is not pirated any longer. At first glance, the flag may be confused with the flag of Bahrain, but at closer look we can find several differences. The red color of Bahrain´s flag is lighter, it has only five instead of nine teeth, and the ratio of the sides is quite different as well.
143#taiwan#The flag of Taiwan consists of a red leaf bearing a small blue rectangle in the upper left part of the flag. In the middle of the rectangle, a sun with twelve rays is located. The flag has been adopted in 1949 when the Chinese communists defeated the Kuomintang, which subsequently established an exile government in Taiwan. The red is a traditional Chinese color and the sun rays represent twelve hours of day and night, thus indirectly symbolize the progress of the country. The sun itself stands for yang principles and the colors together denote three basic principles of humanity - patriotism, democracy and chastity. The Taiwanese flag is very similar to the former flag of Burma.

Romania was a long time under the domination of the Soviet Union and, moreover, under the baton of the Ceausescu the regime was very close to tyranny. Ceausescu was overthrown and executed in 1989 and people began to prefer the flag without the coat of arms as an expression of resistance against the previous regime. Shortly after, this version of the flag was adopted officially.
146#russia#Russian flag is composed of three horizontal stripes of equal width. Red, blue and white are considered traditional Pan-Slavic colors and wide number of states adopted them in the 19th century since Russia was at that time the only independent Slavic state. During the rule of the Communist Party, the tricolor was replaced by the red flag with a hammer and a sickle in the upper left part of the flag. After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, Kremlin decided to return to traditional tricolor. There are many theories explaining the symbolism of the tricolor.

The white color of the star also indicates peace and prosperity, and its symbolism is of great importance for Somalia as a country ravaged by a series of wars and coups.
164#south africa#The flag of South Africa was adopted after the first elections and the end of apartheid in 1994. This is also related to the symbolism of the flag and the letter "Y", which stretches from the left to the right side. It indicates the efforts to bring closer the groups separated for so many years and their common future without conflicts. The variety of colors on the flag stands for the plurality of political and ethnic groups in the country, that is why the flag is sometimes called "rainbow flag". Like on the flag of the African National Congress, three of these colors are black, green and yellow. Red, white and blue represent the Boer republics, and also the colors of political party Zulu are included.
165#south korea#The state flag of South Korea was adopted in 1950 after the division of the country into the northern and the southern territory.

In the left upper part, the national coat of arms is located. Its fields represent Castile, Leon, Aragon, Navarre, and Grenada.

The inscription "Plus Ultra" on a red ribbon wrapped around the columns has been used since the discovery of America and indicates that unlike the original conviction, there is more land in the west direction from Gibraltar.
168#sri lanka#The "Lion Flag" of Sri Lanka was adopted in 1948, but it was used as a symbol of justice for a long time before. Its main motive is yellow lion on a red field holding a sword as a symbol of power. Green and red stripes were added to the left part of the flag after 1815 and these stripes are intended to symbolize Hindu Tamils and Muslim Maurs minorities living on the island beside the Sinhalese majority. Moreover, after renaming in 1972 from Ceylon to Sri Lanka, four yellow leaves were added to the lion´s field. Each leaf should remind one of the Buddhist values - kindness, compassion and desire to be a benefit for the society, joy, peace and well-balanced mind.

The shield and arms meant to symbolize readiness of Swaziland people to fight for their territory. Tufts of feathers represent Swaziland royal dynasty. Dark red stripe represents past bloodsheds and black and white on the shield reminds racial tolerance in the country.
172#sweden#The Swedish flag was most likely inspired by the oldest Nordic flag - Danish Danneborg. Yellow cross on a blue background reaches the edges of the flag and its shorter arm is located closer to the left side of the flag. The characteristic yellow and blue color have probably originated in the 14th century, when the Swedish coat of arms with three gold crowns on a blue background was created. The flag has been used since 1521 and it became very popular during the reign of Gustav I Vasa. At that time, the yellow cross had to be compulsorily pictured on every cocard and battalion. However, the flag in its present form has not been adopted until 1906.
173#switzerland#The roots of the Swiss square flag with the traditional white isosceles cross on a red background date back to the Middle Ages. At that time, Switzerland was a part of the Holy Roman Empire and thus the cross symbolizes Christianity and red color refers to the blood of Christian martyrs. In the 13th century, several Swiss administrative units had joined together and then succeeded in gaining independence from the Holy Roman Empire. Therefore, the flag may evoke independence and democracy. As Switzerland is known for its long term political neutrality, the flag may also symbolize peace and a safe asylum. An interesting fact is that the exact dimensions of the cross or shade of red are not predetermined, so the versions of the flag may slightly differ.
174#syrya#The Syrian flag consists of tricolor of horizontal stripes of red, white, and black color. Furthermore, there are two green five-pointed stars in the middle of the white stripe. The tricolor was adopted during the struggle for independence from the Ottoman Empire in the early 20th century.

Since that time, the flag has changed several times, but the pan-Arab colors remained. The current flag was adopted in 1980 for the second time - for the first time it was in 1958, when Syria formed the United Arab Republic together with Egypt. An interesting fact is that after a change of political situation in the alliance, the stars were replaced by symbol of hawk for a short time, which currently is a dominant of the Egyptian flag.
175#tajikistan#The flag of Tajikistan consists of three horizontal stripes in red, white and green colors. Furthermore, in the middle of the white stripe, there is an emblem displaying a gold crown with seven stars above. The colors of the flag are inspired by the Tajik pledge from the days of dominance of the Soviet Union. The red color serves as a reminder of the communist past of the country, the white stripe stands for cotton production and green stripe refers to advanced agricultural production of Tajikistan. The gold stars represent friendship toward the other nations and the crown symbolizes the country's sovereignty. Tajikistan has not adopted a national flag until 1992 - quite late after the collapse of the USSR compared to the other newly formed states.
176#tanzania#The flag of Tanzania has been adopted in 1964 and it is composed of blue and green orthogonal triangles in the upper left and lower right corners. The triangles are separated by a black stripe, which is bordered by a narrower yellow stripe. The flag has been inspired by the flags of Tanganyika and Zanzibar - two states, which merged in order and created Tanzania. The green field is borrowed from the flag of Tanganyika and it refers to the agricultural tradition in this area and its lush vegetation. Blue reminds the Indian Ocean surrounding Zanzibar. Black color represents the original inhabitants of Tanzania and yellow symbolizes the country's mineral wealth.
177#thailand#The current flag of Thailand is known as trairanga, which means tricolor. Also, Thailand is sometimes called "the country of a white elephant" since the original flag carried in its center a symbol of elephant. However, the elephant has been in 1917, when the country entered the war, replaced by a blue stripe. Since then, the flag bears a red-white-blue tricolor which should have referred to solidarity with allies in the First World War, especially with France. The flag has not been changed since that time, it has stayed the same even after renaming the country from Siam to Thailand in 1939. The interpretation of colors on the flag is as follows: blue represents the monarchy, the white purity of the nation and Buddhism and the red stands for blood shed by the local population while fighting for freedom.
178#togo#The flag of Togo was designed by Aheyi Paul and it has been adopted in 1960. It consists of five horizontal stripes altering between green and orange-yellow color. In the pole part of the flag, a red square that bears symbol of white five-pointed star is placed. The colors used are of classic pan-African symbolism, therefore, it stands for solidarity among all the independent African nations. The flag´s design is very similar to Liberian flag. Five lanes allegedly represent the five regions of the country - the coast, the plateau, the central region, Kara region and savannas. Another interpretation says that the five bars indicate five fingers, which should symbolize human behavior.
179#tonga#The flag of a Pacific state Tonga is one of the older flags, it dates from 1863. For its excessive resemblance to the flag of the Red Cross, it has been slightly modified in 1863.

The cross is supposed to symbolize the Christian faith of Tonga´s inhabitants and red color stands for the Jesus Christ´s blood.

Currently, Tonga benefits mainly from development of tourism and cooperation within the Commonwealth.
180#trinidad and tobago#The flag of the island nation Trinidad and Tobago has been adopted after gaining independence in 1962 and its base consists of a red leaf. From the upper left corner, a diagonal black stripe flanked by narrower white stripes is led. This state was for a long time in the center of interest of colonial powers for its favorable geographic location. The Spaniards fought for it against the Dutch, the French and the British. The British transported to the islands many Indians in order to replace the African population slaving on plantations. As a consequence, Trinidad and Tobago is one of the most multicultural countries. The symbolism of the colors on the flag is as follows: black represents the unity of the local population, red stands for vitality and strength, and white is to commemorate the ripples on the sea surrounding the islands and the purity of ideals of the locals.
181#tunisia#The flag of Tunisia was adopted in 1835 and it has not changed much since then. Red leaf bears the traditional symbols of Islam - red crescent and five-pointed star in a white circle, which is meant to symbolize the sun. These symbols also point to the historical ties to the Ottoman Empire. The flag may resemble a flag of Turkey as Tunisia was for several centuries dominated by Turkish, though the moon and stars have a white color in case of Turkish flag. Also, there is no white circle. The flag in this form (with slight modifications), exists from the 19th century approximately, so it endured the period of French domination up to gaining the independence in 1956.
182#turkey#Turkish flag consists of a red leaf with a symbol of white crescent and a five-pointed star that are located in the left part of the flag. The symbolism of all these elements has its roots in ancient history. The red color was used by the Ottoman Empire, whose origins date back to the 13th century. Crescent and star are ancient symbols of Islam, however it appeared in Turkey even before Islam. Crescent has been on the flag since the 16th century and it is a symbol of the goddess Diana, guardian of the city Byzancion. The star, originally eight-pointed, has been on the flag since 1793 and is associated with the Virgin Mary, whom Constantinople (later Istanbul) was consecrated. Allegedly, these symbols were chosen by Sultan Murad II., when he saw the moon and stars in a puddle of blood during the Battle of Kosovo in 1448.
183#turkmenistan#The flag of Turkmenistan is considered one of the most complicated flags. The base consists of dark green leaf with five white five-pointed stars and motif of a white crescent in the upper middle section.

Turkmenistan is renowned producer of carpets that is why this pattern was used. Under the Gulus, crossed olive branches, which stands for peace of the United Nations, are placed. Five Gulus and five stars represent the five major Turkmen tribes and five provinces of the country. At the same time, the stars along with the crescent and the green color are traditional symbols of Islam.
184#tuvalu#Tuvalu is an archipelago lying in Oceania between Australia and Hawaii. The flag consists of a pale blue sheet and a Union Jack flag in the upper left part of the flag. The blue color of the leaf represents the Pacific Ocean that surrounds the islands. Union Jack signals former ties to the UK, which Tuvalu got rid of in 1978. At that time it was known as the Ellice Islands. Another feature of the flag are nine yellow five-pointed stars, which represent nine inhabited islands that are part of Tuvalu. Unfortunately, Tuvalu is an area with a very low altitude, so is threatened by raising level of the world's oceans.
185#uganda#The flag of Uganda was designed in 1962 by Ugandan minister of Justice Grace Ibingira. It consists of two times repeated tricolor of in total six horizontal stripes of black, yellow and red color - colors characteristic of the Ugandan People's Congress, which came to power in 1962. In the center of the flag, Crowned Crane in a white circle with a red comb is shown. The Crane is a national bird of Uganda and it appeared on the national coat of arms already by the time when Uganda was a British colony. The bird is supposed to symbolize progress of the country. The flag has remained unchanged in spite of numerous political changes and upheavals since its adoption.
186#ukraine#The flag of Ukraine consists of two horizontal stripes - light blue one on the top and bright yellow one at the bottom. The blue stripe represents the sky and the yellow one stands for Ukrainian fertile land and fields. Ukraine has undergone many territorial changes during its existence. It was doing very well in the 10th and 11th century as an independent Kievan Rus, however it was attached to Lithuania later. After gaining independence, it was eventually annexed again, this time to Russia and then to the Soviet Union. In 1991, Ukraine became independent and since 1992 it has started to use the flag in the present form again. Since that time, Ukraine has been facing a series of economic and political problems, so the national colors that also have religious significance are of great importance for Ukrainians.
187#the united arab emirates#The flag of the United Arab Emirates is drawn in unusually arranged pan-Arab colors which should symbolize the unity among Arab nations. It consists of three horizontal stripes in green, white, and black colors. Moreover, the left part of the flag is lined with a red vertical stripe. Red is the color of Khawarijs and the white stripe has its origins in the period after 1820, when a maritime agreement with Britain was signed. Among others, the agreement stated that every member country ship was obliged to put on its flag a white stripe so that their ships can be distinguished from the pirate’s ships. The country had been fragmented for a long time and the Arab Emirates were not unified until 1971, when the national flag has been adopted.
188#the united kingdom#Flag of the United Kingdom - also known to the British as a Union Jack, has been used since 1603 when the Scottish King James VI became the king of England. The symbolism of the flag expresses the linkage between England, Scotland, and Wales. The central theme is a red cross of St. George, who is considered to be the patron of England. The cross is fringed by wider white cross and everything is set in a blue background. The white diagonal cross should remind of St. Andrew, the patron of Scotland. Ireland is represented by a red diagonal cross, which is the symbol of the Irish patron St. Patrick. The Irish cross has not been added until 1801, when Ireland became a member of the United Kingdom. Union Jack motif can be found on many flags as a reminder of Britain's past as a colonial power.
189#the united states of america#The flag of the United States was mentioned for the first time in 1777. Its author was probably Congressman Francis Hopkinson, who took an inspiration from the flag of Sons of Liberty - a group of activists protesting against the introduction of English customs in the American colonies. The thirteen stripes should symbolize the first colonies involved in these fights, originally together with thirteen stars arranged in the circle. The current form of the flag, which was adopted in 1912, kept thirteen stripes indicating the first member states. However, the number of stars increased with accession of new members from 13 to 50. The last star was added in 1960, when Hawaii officially became a part of the US.
190#uruguay#The flag of Uruguay consists of nine horizontal stripes where for of them are blue and five are white.

Nine stripes indicate nine Uruguayan provinces, which were created after the liberation from Brazil in 1828. Prior to Brazilian domination, Uruguay was also ruled by Spanish and Portuguese, and it was called "Banda Oriental" (East Coast). The Sun of May should remind gaining the independence, which took place in May. The design of the flag is probably influenced by the style of American and Argentine flag.
191#uzbekistan#The flag of Uzbekistan, which has been adopted in 1991, consists of three horizontal stripes of blue, white and green colors that are separated by two narrower red stripes.
